# DrinkBeer-Forge1.20


## I am not the original author of this mod, nor do I manage the curseforge page for it. This means that no change made on this repo will matter for the downloadable version of the mod on curseforge.
### Hello  from me as well.
I am not even the author of the 1.18 repo as you may see. The thing is still in development and not compilable as of yet. Once I get this thing working I'll contact the original author on how to publish this version, until then patients.
And thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TurtyWurty">Turty Wurty </a> for the 1.20 dev tutorial
